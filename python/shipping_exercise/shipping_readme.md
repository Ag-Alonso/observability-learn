# Sal's Shipping

Sal runs the biggest shipping company in the tri-county area, **Sal’s Shippers**. Sal wants to make sure that every single one of his customers has the best, and most affordable experience shipping their packages.

In this project, you’ll build a program that will take the weight of a package and determine the cheapest way to ship that package using Sal’s Shippers.

Sal’s Shippers has several different options for a customer to ship their package:

- **Ground Shipping**: a small flat charge plus a rate based on the weight of your package.
- **Ground Shipping Premium**: a much higher flat charge, but you aren’t charged for weight.
- **Drone Shipping** (new): no flat charge, but the rate based on weight is triple the rate of ground shipping.

## Task List

### Ground Shipping

1. Define a `weight` variable and set it equal to any number.

2. Write a comment that says **“Ground Shipping”**.

   Create an `if / elif / else` statement that checks the weight and prints the cost of shipping a package using ground shipping.

3. A package that weighs **8.4 pounds** should cost **$53.60** to ship with normal ground shipping:


Test that your calculation produces this value.

### Ground Shipping Premium

4. Create a variable for the cost of **Ground Shipping Premium**.

> Note: This does not need an `if` statement because the price does not change with weight.

5. Print the cost of Ground Shipping Premium.

---

### Drone Shipping

6. Write a comment for this section of the code: **“Drone Shipping”**.

Create an `if / elif / else` statement that checks the weight and prints the cost of shipping a package using drone shipping.

7. A package that weighs **1.5 pounds** should cost **$6.75** to ship by drone:



Test that your calculation produces this value.
